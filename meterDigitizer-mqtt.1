.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBmeterDigitizer-mqtt\fP is daemon that makes bridge between meterDigirizer device and MQTT broker. 
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are understood:
.PP
\fB\-\-config \fP\fIconfig\fP
.RS 4
Configuration file
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-device \fP\fIdevice\fP
.RS 4
Connect to tty device \fIdevice\fP
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-device-topic \fP\fItopic\fP
.RS 4
Basename of topic to publish/suscribe to
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-sensor-topic \fP\fIsubtopic\fP
.RS 4
Subtopic for sensors to publish/suscribe to
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-host \fP\fIhostname|domain\fP
.RS 4
Hostname or domain name for MQTT broker (see \fBNOTES\fP)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-port \fP\fIport\fP
.RS 4
Port of MQTT broker (see \fBNOTES\fP)
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-keep-alive \fP\fIkeep-alive\fP
.RS 4
Keep-alive timeout of MQTT broker connection in seconds
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-username \fP\fIusername\fP
.RS 4
Username to MQTT broker
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-passwd \fP\fIpassword\fP

.RE
.SH NOTES
If \fIport\fP argument is not specified, the daemon at first tries to resolve \fIdomain\fP SRV record to connect to broker, and connects to domain-specified host and port.
If connection or resolving failed it tries to connect to specified host with default port 1883. Otherwise if \fIport\fP is specified, daemon connects directly to \fIhostname\fP:\fIport\fP.
.SH FILES
.PP

.RS 4
The configuration files a read in specified order overwriting values from each other. The command line arguments have highest priority.
.br
Each line of configuration file consists of pair \fBoption\fP=\fIvalue\fP, where options are same as arguments, excluding leading double dash.
.br
For example configuration file with next content:
.RS 8
username = mqttuser
.br
passwd = mqttpasswd
.br
host = example.org
.RE
is equivalent to executing program with next arguments:
.RS 8
meterDigitizer-mqtt --username mqttuser --passwd mqttpasswd --host example.org
